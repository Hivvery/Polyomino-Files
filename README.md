# Polyomino-Files

These are my Python projects about Polyominoes, which are shapes made of squares connected together. One of them is for finding the amounts of polyominoes with certain properties and the other is for solving puzzles about fitting polyominoes into grids.

## Solver instructions

Click on the piece buttons to add them and the added pieces to remove them. Use the buttons in the bottom right to change the grid size. Click on the grid tiles to remove them and add them back if already removed. Use the "Solve" button to make the program start looking for a solution.
